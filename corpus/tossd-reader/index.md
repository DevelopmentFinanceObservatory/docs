# tossd-reader

Total Official Support for Sustainable Development (TOSSD) is an international standard tracked by the International Forum on TOSSD at [tossd.online](https://tossd.online). It measures cross-border development finance under Pillar I and expenditures for global public goods under Pillar II. The published dataset covers six years (2019 to 2024) across 2.4 million activity-level records.

`tossd-reader` provides Python analysts with typed, cached pandas DataFrames loaded directly from these official records. Annual files download once and cache locally on disk, so repeat queries run from local storage.

## Quick verification

A single query reproduces the 2024 published headline figures of USD 364.1 billion for Pillar I and USD 133.6 billion for Pillar II directly from the raw activity records.

```python
import tossd_reader as tossd

df = tossd.get_tossd(years=2024, columns="minimal", units="usd_million")
df.groupby("tossd_pillar")["usd_disbursement"].sum().round(1)
```

```text
tossd_pillar
1    364114.1
2    133561.8
Name: usd_disbursement, dtype: float64
```

## Install

Python 3.12 or newer.

=== "uv"

    ```bash
    uv add git+https://github.com/ONEcampaign/tossd-reader.git
    ```

=== "pip"

    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/ONEcampaign/tossd-reader.git
    ```

## What the package handles

- Typed DataFrames with snake_case column names, standard numeric types, nullable integer codes, and string categoricals.
- Provider and recipient filtering by name or official code, with fuzzy suggestions for misspelled names.
- Double-counting protection through the `is_aggregate` flag to separate activity-level transactions from summary records.
- Domain helpers for multi-goal SDG weighting and thematic keyword tags for climate and gender, plus typed constant-price columns ready for year-over-year comparison.
- Automatic disk caching to accelerate repeat queries.

## Data size and workflow

- Initial queries for a year download the full published annual dataset (55 to 91 MB per year).
- The `columns="minimal"` preset loads the core financial and classification fields, keeping memory usage low during interactive analysis.
- Query parameters filter on years, providers, recipients, and pillars at load time. The `filters=` argument extends load-time filtering to sector, purpose, channel, modality, and three more dimensions. See [How to filter by sector](how-to/filter-by-sector.md).

## Where to start

- [Build a six-year Senegal disbursement trend](tutorials/first-analysis.md) walks through a query, provider rankings, multi-year trends, and constant prices for Senegal.
- [About pillars and aggregate rows](about/pillars-and-aggregates.md) explains how Pillar I and Pillar II differ and how to handle summary records safely.
- [About the amount columns](about/amounts.md) details current prices, constant prices, and the eight financial metrics in the dataset.
- [Query](https://onecampaign.github.io/tossd-reader/latest/reference/query/) documents `get_tossd()`, its filter parameters, and code resolution helpers.
